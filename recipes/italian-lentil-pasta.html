            <li>Rosemary fresh</li>
            <li>1 L Vegetable stock 4.2 cups</li>
            <li>Pecorino Cheese As much as preferred</li>

    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put your large pot on the stove at medium heat and add 5 tablespoons of EVOO.</li>
            <li>Add chopped carrots, celery, and onions and cook for about 10 minutes while stirring occasionally along with a small amount of vegetable stock to prevent veggies from burning.</li>
            <li>Mix through the crushed garlic cloves, followed by more vegetable stock and a few sprigs of rosemary sprigs, then stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Once the veggies become tender, add guanciale and let it cook until it starts to brown</li>
            <li>Add lentils; tossing them before adding stock so they absorb all the liquid.</li>
            <li>Pour in half of the vegetable stock and give everything a good stir, then add 5 tablespoons of tomato passata and mix it through.</li>
            <li>Cook on medium-high heat and keep an eye on lentils to make sure they don’t dry up by adding water or stock as required.</li>
            <li>Next, mix through the remaining vegetable stock, cover the pot, and let the lentils cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the lentils turn soft with a slight crunch, remove the rosemary.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and stir well before adding the water, then let the pasta cook until al dente</li>
            <li>Taste it to check the texture, then add water so it is covered before a sprinkle of salte and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid, and let it cook for about 5 minutes then stir well so nothing sticks to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Add more water as the pasta absorbs liquid quickly then get the pot off the stove, let the pasta rest for about a minute, and stir to make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Toss the pasta a little bit and add some pecorino cheese on top before another sprinkle of cheese and mix it one final time.</li>
            <li>Serve this creamy lentil pasta on a large serving plate with a generous sprinkling of -you guessed it – more pecorino cheese!</li>
        </ol>
